## Well, after cleaning the data and preparing it for the machine learning model, it's time to work on the model.

# But before that,

let's see how our data values ​​are related to each other or how they relate to the goal(price).

 well As you can see, there is a linear relationship between  year vs price, and in the same way, there is a direct relationship between  year vskilometer.Of course, it is natural for  year vs kilometer that they have a direct relationship with each other. 

 ### This can give us a good overview that we need to understand which models are better to work with

 # The next thing to do is to find the best model and build it

 for the model , First, we specify the features and target, and then we divide the data into test and training data

## Well, I chose three models,(LinearRegression) ,(RandomForestRegressor),(XGBRegressor) and then I considered them in a simple way and compared them to see how each of them worked.

## For the error difference metric, since the problem was a linear problem, I used MAE

## After training, I realized that RandomForestRegressor has the best performance

### Out of curiosity, I checked to see which feature had the most impact on the model

In the next step, I drew a graph of actual and predicted values ​​to see
Has the model drawn the best line?

# In the next step

### it's time to build the model we chose and make it the best it can be. For this, I used one of the best methods of Hyperparameter Tuning, which is grid search

for Hyperparameter Tuning and grid search check the link below

https://www.run.ai/guides/hyperparameter-tuning#grid

Grid search finds the best hyperparameters for us and we create them

## Finally, our best model shows MIA 23,888,967. This means, for example, if our test sample has a real value of 500,000,000. The numerical model predicts between 488,000,000 and 512,000,000
