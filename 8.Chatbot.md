## Well, I was thinking about how I could display the model and the whole program, 
so I did the first way that came to my mind.

A chatbot that can take the desired inputs of the model from the person and transfer them to the model and finally display the output of the model.

# So what inputs does the model need?

### Year of the car?

### Operation relative to kilometers?

### And what is the type of car?

So we are going to ask these questions to the person. He either types or selects the answers. 

For example, he types the car year and chooses the car type from the options

## For this purpose,

at the beginning of the program, we create an empty list in which to put personal answers.
Make sure to arrange the questions in the order of model inputs

### Because this list is finally given to the model

# Libraries

The python-telegram-bot library is one of the most widely used tools for creating Telegram bots in Python. This library provides access to the Telegram API and includes classes and methods that make the process of building, managing and interacting with users easier. Using this library, you can build bots that receive messages, respond, and even interact with users interactively (like inline buttons).

Descriptions of the classes I imported from this library
Update =
This class represents a new update in Telegram that the bot receives. Each update can contain information such as a new message, a button click, a new user joining a group, etc. In the code above, Update is used to receive user messages and click on inline buttons.

InlineKeyboardButton =
This class creates inline buttons for the Telegram keyboard. Inline buttons are placed on the messages and the user can reply to the bot by clicking these buttons without sending a command. Each inline button includes two main features:

text: The text displayed on the button.
callback_data: Information that is sent as callback data to the bot so that we can identify which button was clicked.
InlineKeyboardMarkup
This class is used to organize and group inline buttons in the keyboard layout. Using InlineKeyboardMarkup, you can place multiple InlineKeyboardButtons in one or more different rows and create an inline keyboard.

Updater =
This class is responsible for managing the main loop of the robot. Updater communicates with the Telegram server and continuously receives updates (messages, clicks, etc.) and sends them to handlers (functions we have defined to handle each type of update). Using this class, we can make the bot listen and react to messages.

CommandHandler =
This class is used to manage various Telegram commands such as /start. When the user submits a specific command, the CommandHandler detects and calls the corresponding function. In the above code, the CommandHandler is used to execute the start function when the /start command is received.

CallbackQueryHandler =
This class is used to manage clicks on inline buttons. Whenever the user clicks on one of the inline buttons, the CallbackQueryHandler receives the callback data (callback_data) and executes the specified function to process it. Here, the button function is called using this handler and processes the information about the clicked button.

The general process of working with this library
Creating commands: With CommandHandler, you can define different commands for the robot.
Inline Buttons: Interactive buttons can be created with InlineKeyboardButton and InlineKeyboardMarkup.
Handle responses: With the CallbackQueryHandler, responses and user clicks can be received and processed.
This library is very powerful and flexible and can be used to build complex robots that meet different user needs.

In the python-telegram-bot library, there are various classes and modules for managing Telegram communications and messages. The code you wrote uses several classes and tools that were added in newer versions of the library. Here is a brief description of each of these classes and modules:

1. Application =
This class is used instead of Updater in new versions of python-telegram-bot. Application is responsible for managing the bot and its interactions with the Telegram server. With this class, we can receive new messages and updates and send them to the appropriate handlers. Also, by using the run_polling method in this class, we can set the robot to receive and process messages continuously.

2. CommandHandler =
This class is used to handle text commands that start with /, such as /start. Using CommandHandler, we can identify a specific command and execute the function associated with it. For example, by defining CommandHandler("start", start), the start function will be executed when the /start command is received.

3. CallbackQueryHandler =
This class is used to handle clicks on inline buttons (buttons placed on the message). Whenever the user clicks on one of these buttons, a callback_query is generated, which this handler processes and calls the corresponding function.

4. MessageHandler =
This class is used to handle plain text messages (which are not a special command) or other types of messages (such as images, videos, etc.). With MessageHandler, we can process user messages based on certain filters (such as text, image, etc.).

5. filters =
The filters module in python-telegram-bot provides a set of predefined filters that allow you to identify and manage specific types of messages. For example, filters.TEXT filters only text messages and filters.PHOTO is for image messages. These filters help the MessageHandler to process only the desired messages.

6. ContextTypes =
This class helps to provide methods to manage information related to each user request. ContextTypes specifies different types of context and can be used to display information such as

1. jdatetime =
The jdatetime library is used to work with dates and times to the solar calendar (Hijri) in Python. This library is similar to datetime in Python, but is specifically designed for the solar calendar. Using jdatetime you can easily manage, calculate and display the solar date in different formats.

2. logging
The logging library is used to record reports and logs in Python. Using this library, you can store and manage information such as critical events, errors, and debug information. This library allows you to log reports with different levels of importance (such as DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) and direct the output of the reports to a file or to the console.

3. pickle
The pickle library is used to serialize (store) and deserialize (load) Python objects. With pickle, you can convert Python objects to binary format, save them to a file, and then reload them in their original form. This library is very useful for storing machine learning models, complex data, and special variables that you want to be preserved between runs.


# For final explanations.

I have written errors in this chat bot, 
so that when the program is launched or used, if there is an error, it will display and type it for you.

## To run this chatbot,

you just need to download the chatbot token you created from Telegram and place it in the `application`.
