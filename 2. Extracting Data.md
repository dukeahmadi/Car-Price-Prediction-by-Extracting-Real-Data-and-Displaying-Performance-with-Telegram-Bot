# What does the site reader do and how?

## First of all

The first challenge for us was how to find real and updated data.
Of course, Keggle and similar sites help a lot, but we didn't want to just create a model to predict,
our goal was to create a complete program that can do its work by itself.

### The purpose of the site reader program is to ask you to enter the URL that you want to download the content of that site, and this program will start to download the last word of that page.
### The site we chose to extract car data is the Bama site, which is a car trading site in Iran, and if you search, you can find it separately for each country.
I will put the link below
https://bama.ir/

Well, for example, I went to this site and searched for Peugeot 206. The site reader starts when you give it the URL of this page and downloads the titles of that page and saves it in a csv.

What do I mean by titles? Let me show you
