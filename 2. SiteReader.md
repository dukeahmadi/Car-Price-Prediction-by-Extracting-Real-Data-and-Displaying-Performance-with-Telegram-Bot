# What does the site reader do and how?

## First of all

The first challenge for us was how to find real and updated data.
Of course, Keggle and similar sites help a lot, but we didn't want to just create a model to predict,
our goal was to create a complete program that can do its work by itself.

### The purpose of the site reader program is to ask you to enter the URL that you want to download the content of that site, and this program will start to download the last word of that page.
### The site we chose to extract car data is the Bama site, which is a car trading site in Iran, and if you search, you can find it separately for each country.
I will put the link below
https://bama.ir/

Well, for example, I went to this site and searched for Peugeot 206. The site reader starts when you give it the URL of this page and downloads the titles of that page and saves it in a csv file.

What do I mean by titles? Let me show you

This information is in Persian, so I will translate it for you so that you can understand exactly what the site reader is doing.

I mean the titles that I colored

Purple = the name of the car

Blue = car price (target)

Red = the year the car was made

Yellow = car performance in kilometers

Green = car model

Note that this information is uploaded by ordinary people on this site during the day, so there is definitely a lot of feature engineering

So the Site Reader will download all these titles for your search until the last one
and puts each sample in a row

# Well,now that we know what the site reader is doing. I want to talk about the code and libraries that you must have in order for this program to work for you

## Of course, it is not possible to teach each and every one of these libraries here, it is expected that you should search for them yourself

### The first library is the Selenium library
To read the content of the site, one of the ways is to use Chrome Driver and Selenium

For ChromeDriver, you need to download the version compatible with your browser. Use the ChromeDriver site.
https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/downloads

Now, if you look at the code of the site reader, you will see that in the first four lines of the code
There is `csv_path` and `driver_path`. 

What are these and what do they do? 

Basically, the whole point and perhaps the difficulty of this program is this part

### For `csv_path`, you must create an empty folder and copy and paste its path. Note that all your csv files will be saved in this folder

### Now for `driver_path` . Don't worry, all you have to do is download the ChromeDriver. Place the exe file in the path of Windows and place the same path in the place of `driver_path` . For better guidance, you can go to the following site

https://medium.com/@kevinmarkvi/how-to-add-executables-to-your-path-in-windows-5ffa4ce61a53#:~:text=Step%201%3A%20Right%20click%20on%20the%20Windows%20Logo,and%20add%20the%20file%20path%20to%20the%20list

### The `re` library in Python provides support for working with regular expressions. Regular expressions are a powerful tool for matching patterns in text.
So, we convert the downloaded file into a clean csv with regex or `re`
