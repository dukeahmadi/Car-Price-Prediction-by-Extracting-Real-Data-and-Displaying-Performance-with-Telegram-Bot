Car Price Prediction by Extracting Real Data  from the car buying and selling site and Displaying Performance for People with Telegram Bot

I wrote this whole program in a boring weekend and as a hobby. But I think it has parts that can help others, so I turned it into a repository to make it available to the public. This whole program is a small part of what it can really offer. Together, when these programs are connected, they can do their work separately from any other system, but it is much better if it is part of a big project. For example, it should be used in car trading sites to guide users.

### The purpose of this project 

to advise the price of cars on a reasonable level 
so that people do not pay high or low prices for their products when buying or selling cars.

There are interesting features in this repository. From crawling on the web to machine learning and building a Telegram chatbot. 
Definitely, by studying each section, you can get a good and basic view of these three paths. `web crawler` , `machine learning` , `Telegram chatbot`

### I have written separate explanations for each section, 
make sure you read that section before looking at the codes. I explained all the libraries you need in that section

# In the end, 

## I want to say that this program has a lot of room for improvement.

### For example, after reading this repository, ask yourself 

How do I connect these three separate programs together?

what to do if I want to automate the whole process so that every day at one hour the web crawler starts and gives a new data set and update to the model?

Or if we want to use several cars instead of one car, how should we act? Should I convert our model to a neural network model? Or create separate machine learning models for each car and find out through the chatbot which car the customer needs to activate the machine learning model of that car.

In the end, I hope this repository has helped you
