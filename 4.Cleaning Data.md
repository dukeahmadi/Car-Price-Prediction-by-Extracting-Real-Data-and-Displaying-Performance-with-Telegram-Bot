## Now you have reached the point where you used the site reader and you have a csv file of the data on the site you want. 
I am going with the same previous search that I did for you, which was Peugeot 206. 
Now let's take a look at my csv and let's see how I improve this data for our model to improve the performance of our machine learning model.

The strategy I have here is to clean the data first, because the model definitely does not understand these initial values, and the next step is to look for a new feature.

The first thing I notice is that in the model column,
all the models have one word in common, which is **type** ("تیپ"), so the best decision is to get rid of it.

In the model column, there is another word called **panorama** ("پانوراما"),
but many examples do not have this word. It might be good to not consider it at all and delete it. 

### But what if it affects the decision of the model? 
I think the best decision is to separate the value and transfer it to a new column and limit it to a boolean value.

###I do not do anything for the year and kilometer column
because they are numbers. And they don't have missing values

And the name is not important here
